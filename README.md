The Form.io application server
===============================
Form.io is a revolutionary Form and API platform for developers. This repository serves as the core Form and API engine
for https://form.io. This system allows you to build next generation Web 3.0 applications using a simple drag-and-drop
form builder interface. These forms can then easily be embedded within your Angular.js and React applications using the
```<formio>``` HTML element. 

Installation
-------------------
To get started you will first need the following installed on your machine.

  - Node.js - https://nodejs.org/en/
  - MongoDB - http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/
  
You can then download this repository, navigate to the folder in your Terminal, and then type the following.

```
npm install
node server
```

This will walk you through the installation process.  When it is done, you will have a running Form.io management
application running at the following address in your browser.

```
http://localhost:3001
```

Usage
--------------------
Form.io works by creating both Resources and Forms within your application. The easiest way to get started is to use
https://form.io to bootstrap some existing application to see how they are constructed. The easiest one to start off
with is the ToDo application found at https://github.com/formio/formio-app-todo.
